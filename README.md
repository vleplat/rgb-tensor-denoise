# SR_Project
A lightweight post-processing toolbox to smooth super-resolution (SR) images with patch-based denoising using Tucker and Tensor Train (TT) decompositions. Designed to reduce tiling artifacts via high-order tensor modeling and superpixel-aware segmentation. Includes adaptive TT compression and support for higher-order reshaping.
